# Web-Socket
Hello Friends,
Here I uploaded a simple Web-Socket example that runs on your Local Host.

To connect it with server:
Open command prompt and change Directory(cd Your_Folder) to you project folder.
type "npm install" //that will install node modules which needs
node index.js // Your all set 
open your html file and you can see the logs on cmd prompt.

//You can also upload the file on heroku.
See my heroku file: http://nodeyy.herokuapp.com
Thanks
